        <h2>Why is Nutrition Important?</h2>
        <h3>Nutrition is one of the most vital parts of sustaining a long and healthy life.
          We derive most of our nutrients and vitamins from the food that we consume.</h3>

        <p>It can be incredibly hard to lead a healthy lifestye in the technical workforce. Most of us will go on to work jobs where we're sitting for hours on end,
          with little-to-no regard for our physical wellbeing. Let alone considering our nutrition, <br> and the overwhelming effects it can have on our lives. 
          <br>
          <br>
          We can all very easily take small steps to improving this, however. And even as daunting the idea of meal prepping, or considering what we purchase and put in our bodies, can be. It trully isn't so bad once we start. <br>
          <br>
          Below I will be giving a few tips, tricks, and examples that we can all implement in order to live this healthier lifestyle.

        <p>Becoming more food consious, and being much more aware of the decisions we make on a daily basis in regards to how to fuel ourselves, will come with the added benefit<br>
          of less calories being consumed on average as well. Pairing this with other healthy habits such as going for walks to achieve a <a href="exercise.html#step_count">step count goal</a>, will in most cases<br>
          cause us to achieve healthier weights as well. Attaining and maintaining these healthier weights come with a whole slough of benefits themselves, such as lower risk of<br>
          heart failure and other cholestorol related illnesses. Though we won't dive too deep into that topic on this page. If you're interested, you can visit our page on <a href="Exercise.html">exercise</a>.
