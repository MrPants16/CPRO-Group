            but I've decided to keep the vast amount of <div> elements I've included on my page until I go through and add my CSS to it. 
            so that I can then decide if I want to use them for individual css class/ids, or not. I will cleanup and remove extra bloat <div> elements then. -->
        <h2>Why is Nutrition Important?</h2>
        <h3>Nutrition is one of the most vital parts of sustaining a long and healthy life.
            We also derive most of our nutrients and vitamins from the food that we consume.</h3> <!-- I know that tabbing in my content to line-up may not necessarilly be "best practice" but it looks neater to me and makes it
                                                                                                  easier for me to read within VScode, so I've done it throughout my page -->

        <p>It can be incredibly hard to lead a healthy lifestye in the technical workforce. Most of us will go on to work jobs where we're sitting for hours on end, <!-- you will see me use <br> often to also continue a paragraph on the next line. -->
          with little-to-no regard for our physical wellbeing. Let alone considering our nutrition, <br> and the overwhelming effects it can have on our lives.</p> <!-- ^ I only did this because without doing so, the content stretched way too far horizontally on my home monitor, and I didn't like how it looked. I'm sure with CSS I can force it to wrap more neatly. Or perhaps find a better solution in html -->
        <p>We can all very easily take small steps to improving this, however. And even as daunting the idea of meal prepping, or considering what we purchase and put in our bodies, can be. It trully isn't so bad once we start.</p>
          <br> <!-- wanted a tiny bit more space between these two -->
        <p>Below I will be giving a few tips, tricks, and examples that we can all implement in order to live this healthier lifestyle.</p>

        <h2>What steps can you take to improve your nutrition?</h2>
          <p>There are tonnes of small changes that you can implement into your daily
            life that can greatly improve your nutrition. In no order, a few of these are as simple as:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Drinking more water</li>
            <li>Simple substitutes such as <span>avocado oil</span> instead of butter</li>
            <li>Eating healthier whole foods, and home meals instead of takeout</li>
            <li>Substituting snacks with higher volume meals, consisting of more protein dense as well as green foods</li> 
          </ul>
        <h2>Some easy substitutions that can be made immediately are provided below:</h2>

      <h3>Added benefits of food substitutions</h3> <!-- used an article here instead of <section> as I believe this to be content that doesn't necessarily pertain to the main theme of the page, but definitely adds to it -->
        <p>Becoming more food consious, and being much more aware of the decisions we make on a daily basis in regards to how to fuel ourselves, will come with the added benefit<br>
          of less calories being consumed on average as well. Pairing this with other healthy habits such as going for walks to achieve a <a href="exercise.html#step_count">step count goal</a>, will in most cases<br>
          cause us to achieve healthier weights as well. Attaining and maintaining these healthier weights come with a whole slough of benefits themselves, such as lower risk of<br>
          heart failure and other cholestorol related illnesses. Though we won't dive too deep into that topic on this page. If you're interested, you can visit our page on <a href="Exercise.html">exercise</a>.
