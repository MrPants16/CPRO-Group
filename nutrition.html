        <h2>Why is Nutrition Important?</h2>
        <h3 class="intro-header">
          Nutrition is one of the most vital parts of sustaining a long and
          healthy life. We also derive most of our nutrients and vitamins from
          the food that we consume.
        </h3>
        <p>
          It can be incredibly hard to lead a healthy lifestye in the
          technical workforce. Most of us will go on to work jobs where we're
          sitting for hours on end,
          with little-to-no regard for our physical wellbeing. Let alone
          considering our nutrition,
          and the overwhelming effects it can have on our lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can all very easily take small steps to improving this, however.
          And even as daunting the idea of meal prepping, or considering what
          we purchase and put in our bodies, can be. It trully isn't so bad
          once we start.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below I will be giving a few tips, tricks, and examples that we can
          all implement in order to live this healthier lifestyle.

        <h2>The Nutrients and Vitamins we derive from our diet:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Help us to fight off illness and disease</li>
          <li>Supply us with energy</li>
          <li>Sustain our Body and Mind</li>
        </ol>

      <div class="grid-steps">
        <h2>What steps can you take to improve your nutrition?</h2>
        <p>
          There are tonnes of small changes that you can implement into your
          daily life that can greatly improve your nutrition. In no order, a
          few of these are as simple as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Drinking more water</li>
          <li>Simple substitutes such as <span>avocado oil</span> instead of butter</li>
          <li>Eating healthier whole foods, and home meals instead of takeout</li>
          <li>Substituting snacks with higher volume meals, consisting of more protein dense as well as green foods</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="grid-addedbens">
        <h2>Added benefits of food substitutions.</h2>
        <p>
          Becoming more food consious, and being much more aware of the
          decisions we make on a daily basis in regards to how to fuel
          ourselves, will come with the added benefit
          of less calories being consumed on average as well. Pairing this with
          other healthy habits such as going for walks to achieve a
          <a href="exercise.html#step_count">step count goal</a>, will in most
          cases
          cause us to achieve healthier weights as well. Attaining and
          maintaining these healthier weights come with a whole slough of
          benefits themselves, such as lower risk of
          heart failure and other cholestorol related illnesses. Though we won't
          dive too deep into that topic on this page. If you're interested, you
          should check out our page on <a href="Exercise.html">exercise</a>!
