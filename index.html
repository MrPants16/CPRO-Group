<!-- Disclaimer from the "Fatherly Advice" Team! The three of us (Austin Durette, Tyson Volk, and Rylan Rees) Worked together on our index page.
 And individually: Austin did nutrition.html, Rylan did exercise.html, and Tyson did Rest.html
 Beyond that, we felt it would still be rather disingenuous to remove the hygiene.html page that Jackson submitted to us. We would just like to request
 that his efforts on his individual page do not reflect poorly on the efforts we made to our individual pages and our landing page (jackson did not touch index.html)-->

          Fatherly Advice! <small style="font-size: 8px">(patent pendig)</small>
          is a small and quick collective of helpful tips that we believe everyone in
          our field could benefit from! Regardless of their current health.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working in the technical field, whichever branch we end up in, tends
          to leave us in a rather stagnant work environment. What we mean by
          this is, we may more often than not find that we are spending hours
          upon hour sitting at our desks. Putting in hour after hour with less
          than ideal posture as we crinkle our brow, upon reading the most
          recent bug report. Or or perhaps we find ourselves so engrossed in our
          task that we forget to move, or eat, for hours on end as the creative
          flow takes over.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though we may not realize it, in both of these scenarios we are
          setting ourselves up for failure where personal health and
          accountability is concerned. This can very easily end up with us
          forming bad habits over time, that become painstakingly<br>
          difficult to break. And from the bottom of our hearts, we mean it when
          we say that we wouldn't want that for anyone. We hope that through the
          use of our "beginners guide to health" we have formulated here, that
          everyone<br>
          is able to start considering their health with greater importance and
          take steps towards living a healthier lifestyle! (We are no exception
          to this either.....)

    a<h2>A quick rundown of the topics we've decided to help you with:</h2>
    <section>
      
      <h3>Summary of Excercise</h3> <!-- info, teaser, and links to Rylans page, "exercise.html" -->
      <p>
        Our page of exercise will go over the importance of why it's so vital
        to our health.

    <section>
      <h3>Rest</h3><!-- info, teaser, and links to Tysons page, "rest.html" -->
      <p>
        Sleep is a an essential part of human life. Without it, humans would
        not be able to function to their full potential which is why we explain why sleep
        is good for you. Not ONLY do we explain why sleep is an incredible thing to do, we give sleep
        recommendations as in the hours the average ... year old needs so everyone feels included and we also go over

      <h3>Nutrition</h3> <!-- info, teaser, and links to Austins page, "nutrition.html" -->
      <p>
        When considering the steps we can actively take to work on and improve our health, nutrition is simultaneously
        the easiest and most difficult change to put into practice. Considering both sides of that double-edged sword,
        nutrition is extremely easy to implement, as it can be as simple as monitoring and adjusting the products we
        consume on a daily basis.
        Ironically, this is also how nutrition can be the most difficult: it's not easy to continuously be mindful of
        what you consume
        or to stay on top of meal prepping and cooking at home, rather than relying on instant meals or fast food.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thankfully, there are plenty of available resources to help build and reinforce these habits, improving our
        nutrition.

      <h3>Hygiene</h3>
      <p>
        Cleanliness and personal hygiene is arguably the most imporant factor when talking about self-care and health.
        Moreso when we take into consideration the
        affect that your own hygiene can have on other people. This can altar perspective and interactions with others.
        A lack of personal hygiene can also put
        you at greater risk for a myriad of health issues. We will delve deeper into this topic on our <a
          href="hygiene.html">hygiene</a> page.
