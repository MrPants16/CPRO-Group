<!-- Disclaimer from the "Fatherly Advice" Team! The three of us (Austin Durette, Tyson Volk, and Rylan Rees) Worked together on our index page.
 And individually: Austin did nutrition.html, Rylan did exercise.html, and Tyson did Rest.html
 Beyond that, we felt it would still be rather disingenuous to remove the hygiene.html page that Jackson submitted to us. We would just like to request
 that his efforts on his individual page do not reflect poorly on the efforts we made to our individual pages and our landing page (jackson did not touch index.html)-->

        <p>
          Fatherly Advice! <small style="font-size: 8px">(patent pendig)</small>
          is a small and quick collective of helpful tips that we believe everyone in
          our field could benefit from! Regardless of their current health.
        </p>
        <p>
          Working in the technical field, whichever branch we end up in, tends
          to leave us in a rather stagnant work environment. What we mean by
          this is, we may more often than not find that we are spending hours
          upon hour sitting at our desks. Putting in hour after hour with less
          than ideal posture as we crinkle our brow, upon reading the most
          recent bug report. Or or perhaps we find ourselves so engrossed in our
          task that we forget to move, or eat, for hours on end as the creative
          flow takes over.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though we may not realize it, in both of these scenarios we are
          setting ourselves up for failure where personal health and
          accountability is concerned. This can very easily end up with us
          forming bad habits over time, that become painstakingly<br>
          difficult to break. And from the bottom of our hearts, we mean it when
          we say that we wouldn't want that for anyone. We hope that through the
          use of our "beginners guide to health" we have formulated here, that
          everyone<br>
          is able to start considering their health with greater importance and
          take steps towards living a healthier lifestyle! (We are no exception
          to this either.....)

    <h2>A quick rundown of the topics we've decided to help you with:</h2>

    <div class="card-container">
      <section class="card">  
        <h3>Excercise</h3> <!-- info, teaser, and links to Rylans page, "exercise.html" -->
        <p>
          Our page of exercise will go over the importance of why it's so vital
          to our health.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exercise improves physical health, mental well-being, and daily performance. It strengthens muscles and bones, supports heart health, boosts energy, 
          reduces stress, and improves mood. Regular movement also helps manage weight, 
          enhances sleep, and lowers the risk of chronic diseases making it a key part of a healthy, balanced life.
        </p>
        <p> Whether it's strength training, running, or even daily walks, movement keeps both body and mind resilient. 
          Staying active is one of the simplest and most powerful ways to live longer, feel better, and perform at your best.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="card">
        <h3>Rest</h3><!-- info, teaser, and links to Tysons page, "rest.html" -->
        <p>
          Sleep is a an essential part of human life. Without it, humans would
          not be able to function to their full potential which is why we explain why sleep
          is good for you. Not ONLY do we explain why sleep is an incredible thing to do, we give sleep
          recommendations as in the hours the average ... year old needs so everyone feels included and we also go over
          the 5 different phases also known as the 5 different stages of sleep. We hope you enjoy this incredible
          presentation.

        <h3>Nutrition</h3> <!-- info, teaser, and links to Austins page, "nutrition.html" -->
        <p>
          When considering the steps we can actively take to work on and improve our health, nutrition is simultaneously
          the easiest and most difficult change to put into practice. Considering both sides of that double-edged sword,
          nutrition is extremely easy to implement, as it can be as simple as monitoring and adjusting the products we
          consume on a daily basis.
          Ironically, this is also how nutrition can be the most difficult: it's not easy to continuously be mindful of
          what you consume
          or to stay on top of meal prepping and cooking at home, rather than relying on instant meals or fast food.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thankfully, there are plenty of available resources to help build and reinforce these habits, improving our
          nutrition.

      <section class="card">
        <h3>Hygiene</h3>
        <p>Good hygiene is essential for protecting your health and the health of those around you. Proper hygiene habits, 
          such as regular handwashing, showering, brushing your teeth, and wearing clean clothes, prevent the spread of 
          bacteria and viruses that cause illness. </p>
          <p>Maintaining personal cleanliness also supports mental well-being. 
          Feeling clean and presentable boosts confidence and helps you engage more comfortably in social and professional settings. </p>
          <p>Developing strong hygiene habits early ensures long-term benefits for both physical and social health, reinforcing respect for yourself and others.
