        <h3>Other benefits of Excercise</h3>
        <p>Exercise also has a strong correlation to your mood. Achieved by increasing the release of endorphins, and decreasing the cortisol production.</p>
        <p>When you step away from your computer and get moving, your brain gets a boost of oxygen and blood flow. 
            This helps you think more clearly and creatively. Many programmers find that when they hit a mental block on a tough bug or algorithm, 
            going for a quick walk or workout helps them come back with fresh ideas and a new perspective. Exercise makes it easier to solve complex problems.
            Sitting too long will cause stiff muscles and joints which can lead to long term damage. Many people also form posture problems all things helped with excercise.
            Regular physical activity can help you fall asleep faster and deepen your sleep. Just don't exercise too close to bedtime, or you may be too energized to fall asleep.
