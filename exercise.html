        <h3>Exercise is very important to keep our bodys in good shape especially when sitting all day.</h3>
        <p>Here are some things you can do at home: 
        <ul>
            <li>Crunches</li>
            <li>Push ups</li>
            <li>Body squats</li>
            <li>Plank</li>
            <li>Jumping jacks</li>
        </ul>
        Every few hours of sitting get up and go for a little walk or do some activity</p>
        <p>After work you could go for a bike ride or a walk and try and get some steps in. Getting your steps in keeps your heart, bones and muscles healthy
            which helps you live a longer and healthier life.</p>
        <p>Heart disease is the leading cause of death in Canada and the USA so doing as much as you can to keep it healthy is smart. </p>
