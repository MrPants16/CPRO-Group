                <h3>Exercise is very important to keep our bodys in good shape especially when sitting all day</h3>
                <p>You can stay active at home with simple exercises that build strength and endurance without equipment. 
                    Push-ups are one of the best, working your chest, shoulders, and triceps while engaging your core. Bodyweight squats strengthen your legs and 
                    improve balance, while planks help develop stability and posture. Lunges target the lower body and can be done in small spaces, and jumping jacks 
                    or burpees provide a quick cardio boost. By combining these movements into short routines, you can maintain fitness, 
                    improve mobility, and build muscle from the comfort of your home.</p>
                <h3>Every few hours of sitting get up and go for a little walk or do some activity</h3>
                <p>After work, you could go for a bike ride or a walk and try to get some steps in. 
                    Regular physical activity like walking or cycling improves blood circulation, 
                    strengthens your heart muscle, and helps regulate blood pressure and cholesterol levels. 
                    Getting enough daily steps also supports bone density, joint flexibility, and overall muscle tone, 
                    making everyday activities easier as you age. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in Canada and the USA, 
                    largely linked to sedentary lifestyles, poor diet, and stress. Even small changes—like taking the stairs, walking during breaks, 
                    or doing light evening exercise—can significantly reduce your risk. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate activity per week, 
                    as recommended by health guidelines, to improve endurance, boost mood, and maintain long-term cardiovascular health.</p>

                    <p>These exercises can be done at home or while running in your neighborhood, but they serve different purposes.

                         Others, such as push-ups, are better suited for building or maintaining muscle strength.

            <h3 id="benefits">Other benefits of Excercise</h3> <!-- Move details -->
            <p>Exercise also has a strong correlation to your mood. Achieved by increasing the release of endorphins,
                and decreasing the cortisol production.</p>
            <p>When you step away from your computer and get moving, your brain gets a boost of oxygen and blood flow.
                this helps you think more clearly and creatively. Many programmers find that when they hit a mental
                block on a tough bug or algorithm,
                going for a quick walk or workout helps them come back with fresh ideas and a new perspective. Exercise
                makes it easier to solve complex problems.
                Sitting too long will cause stiff muscles and joints which can lead to long term damage. Many people
                also form posture problems all things helped with excercise.
                Regular physical activity can help you fall asleep faster and deepen your sleep. Just don't exercise too
                close to bedtime, or you may be too energized to fall asleep.
