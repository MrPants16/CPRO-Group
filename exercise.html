            <h3>Exercise is very important to keep our bodys in good shape especially when sitting all day.</h3>
            <p>Here are some things you can do at home:
            <ul>
                <li>Crunches</li>
                <li>Push ups</li>
                <li>Body squats</li>
                <li>Plank</li>
                <li>Jumping jacks</li>
            </ul>
            Every few hours of sitting get up and go for a little walk or do some activity</p>
            <p>After work you could go for a bike ride or a walk and try and get some steps in. Getting your steps in
                keeps your heart, bones and muscles healthy
                which helps you live a longer and healthier life.</p>
            <p>Heart disease is the leading cause of death in Canada and the USA so doing as much as you can to keep it
                healthy is key. </p>

            <h3 id="benefits">Other benefits of Excercise</h3> <!-- Move details -->
            <p>Exercise also has a strong correlation to your mood. Achieved by increasing the release of endorphins,
                and decreasing the cortisol production.</p>
            <p>When you step away from your computer and get moving, your brain gets a boost of oxygen and blood flow.
                this helps you think more clearly and creatively. Many programmers find that when they hit a mental
                block on a tough bug or algorithm,
                going for a quick walk or workout helps them come back with fresh ideas and a new perspective. Exercise
                makes it easier to solve complex problems.
                Sitting too long will cause stiff muscles and joints which can lead to long term damage. Many people
                also form posture problems all things helped with excercise.
                Regular physical activity can help you fall asleep faster and deepen your sleep. Just don't exercise too
                close to bedtime, or you may be too energized to fall asleep.
