            <p>Having "good hygiene" is a very broad and often misunderstood topic. At first glance, many individuals see it as very simple actions such as washing your hands properly and showering. However, the concept of exceptional personal hygiene is derived from good internal and external practices.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If someone does not properly maintain themselves, there is a large list of downsides.

On the social level, people may be drawn away from you, leading to a sense of loneliness.</p>
            <p>With that being said, personal hygiene actually has several layers and types to it. Most of these have to do with different areas of the human body.</p>
