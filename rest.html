        <h1>Sleep Phases</h1>
        <div>
            There are 5 sleep phases. The first is stage 1, it is the traditional stage where you start to sleep, marked by slight drowsiness, slowing down of eye movements and very minimal movement of the muscles. During stage 2, you are just slightly deeper in sleep than you were in stage 1. Stage 2 differs in that you are slowing down your rate of your heart and that you are breathing much slower and your body temperature transfers to a colder state. State 3 is considered "deep sleep" and is THE MOST crucial part of sleeping for an individual to endure. In this phase, the person is not as easy to wake up. Their brain waves are very slow. The 4th state is almost identical to that of the 3rd stage. The 5th stage of sleeping, known as the REM stage is when vivid dreams are likliest to occur. Your brain waves are giving off more activity and your muscles are a lot more relaxed. Fun fact: the average person does this about 5 times every night when they sleep.
